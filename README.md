REST Countries API with color theme switcher

I used React to take on the challenge.

The web can: 
- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an input field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
